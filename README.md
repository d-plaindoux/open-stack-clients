open-stack-clients
==================

Based on rAPIdo language we provide a specification for each OpenStack components based on REST.

## Introduction

Current clients in `Python` for instance provides seamless access to OpenStack components using
REST services. But in parallel such clients are not based on a common core. Therefor such approach
implies complexity in the code because the way the clients work (pattern) are different and exceptions
are not homogeneous. In addition such clients exist for different languages like `Java` etc. implying 
also maintenance difficulties. 

## Specification and Generation

This project proposes a complete specification of OpenStack clients using the [rAPIdo](https://github.com/d-plaindoux/rapido) DSL. Then once such specification is ready a transpiler
stage can be performed generating clients for all supported languages providing at the same time
a complete api for `Python`, `Scala` etc.
